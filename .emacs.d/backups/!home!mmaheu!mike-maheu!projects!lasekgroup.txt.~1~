1.1 Plugin Development for their custom plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  JIRA has a lot of highly sensitive PII data. They are a marketing
  company that sends out, tracks, and analysis emails One restriction is
  that the data can't comingle. Ford cant see Dodge info. They used
  permissions to issolate the projects.  Assign project at time of
  creation at the time of adding the account. In the Create Menu, they
  added the Create Project button It uses AD to verify permissions. They
  assign permissions from there. Meta data values that are collected and
  saved.  Used for reporting purposes. They also have custom
  scripts. Fields Samba Link and QDrive.

  They are using ScriptRunner as well. One script finds the value for
  QDrive and SamabLink. They add creative assets on these drives.


  Dan will do a demo to bring our team up to speed.
  - There is a permission scheme that gets created per project. When
    they have to make edits, they have to edit each one. Pehaps have a
    permission scheme per account. Then the scheme could be used for
    multiple projects based on the account.
